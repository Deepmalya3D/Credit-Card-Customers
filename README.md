# Credit Card Customers

As a part of my Visualization Project, I decided to work on Credit Card customer-base dataset. A credit card is a payment card issued to users to enable the cardholder to pay a merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder’s accrued debt. In today’s digital age, it has become an intergate part of day-to-day transactions and money exchange. In this project, we explore the trend and usage of credit card users among different demographics. We use visualization techniques in R to find patterns in the credit card usage dataset and following this, we attempt to find relations between Credit Card Usage, Utilization, Revolving Balance, and other variables. Finally, we develop a dashboard to address the above-posed questions.
